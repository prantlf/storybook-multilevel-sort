# Usage Example of Multi-level Sorting for Storybook 7

Only one group of stories (Components/Navigation/Header) contains an autogenerated (`autodocs`) article, the others contain only hand-written stories.

1. Install Storybook and other dependencies

    npm ci

2. Build a deployable version of the documentation to `storybook-static`

    npm test

3. Launch a development server for the documentation

    npm start

See [`.storybook/main.js`] and [`.storybook/preview.js`] for details of the sorting customisation.

[`.storybook/main.js`]: ./.storybook/main.js
[`.storybook/preview.js`]: ./.storybook/preview.js
